ReleaseNotes: "New Design and User Experience:\n- The user interface in viewer tabs
  has been redesigned to ensure consistency with MightyViewer (a tool you should definitely
  check out \u2014 it might be the perfect fit for your particular needs!).\n- The
  number of saved connections has increased from 10 to 100.\nNew Features:\n- Implemented
  multi-monitor support. Now you can choose a specific monitor in the viewer when
  the remote host has multiple monitors connected. This feature works when connected
  to TightVNC Server for Windows, starting with version 2.8.81.\n- Added desktop scaling.\n-
  Added an option to save VNC passwords.\n- Improved handling of authentication failures.
  The viewer now prompts for a password again if the previous password was incorrect.\n-
  Enabled editing of station names in the list of recent connections.\n- Made logging
  configurable.\nBug Fixes:\n- Fixed an issue where the Home tab failed to display
  on startup.\n- Fixed a keyboard issue with the Alt-Gr key in Spanish, French, and
  German keyboard layouts.\n- Fixed incorrect session saving when starting a connection
  from the address line.\n- Fixed a memory leak (a bug fix in the Remote Core SDK).\n-
  Port numbers can now be specified with a single colon, e.g., :5900, instead of requiring
  two colons (::5900).\n- Various minor improvements and bug fixes.\nOther Improvements:\n-
  Enhanced error handling and improved displaying of error messages.\n- Added links
  to the MightyViewer and Remote Core SDK websites from the Remote Ripple user interface."
